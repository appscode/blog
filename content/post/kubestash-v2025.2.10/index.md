We are pleased to announce the release of [KubeStash v2025.2.10](https://kubestash.com/docs/v2025.2.10/setup/), packed with new features and important bug fixes. You can check out the full changelog [HERE](https://github.com/kubestash/CHANGELOG/blob/master/releases/v2025.2.10/README.md).

### New Features

Here, we are going to highlight the new features that have been introduced in this release.

#### KubeDB Archiver Backup/Restore

We've introduced functionality to back up and restore the KubeDB `Archiver` resource. By default, KubeStash backs up the `Archiver` YAML during the manifest backup of any KubeDB-managed databases.

Below is an example of a `RestoreSession` for restoring an `Archiver` YAML for `MySQL` database:

```yaml
spec:
  init:
    archiver:
      encryptionSecret:
        name: encrypt-secret
        namespace: demo
      fullDBRepository:
        name: mysql-full
        namespace: demo
      recoveryTimestamp: "2025-03-11T14:26:01Z"
      manifestOptions:
        archiver: true
        archiverRef:
          namespace: kubedb
          name:  mysqlarchiver-sample
---
```

> Note: By default, we don't restore `Archiver`. If you want to restore set the archiver field `true`.

Here,
- `spec.init.archiver.manifestOptions` specifies that the Archiver YAML should be restored during manifest restoration.
- `spec.init.archiver.manifestOptions.archiverRef` defines the target namespace and name for restoring the Archiver.

#### Single Dump, Multiple Backup Destinations

We've introduced a powerful new feature for database backups. `Multi-writer` support for the `restic` driver. Now, instead of executing a separate `dump` for each backend, we dump the database once and simultaneously stream the data to multiple backup destinations. This improves efficiency and reduces redundancy in the backup process.

Hereâ€™s an example of a `BackupConfiguration` for a `MySQL` database with multiple backup destinations,

```yaml
---
  backends:
    - name: gcs-backend
      storageRef:
        namespace: demo
        name: gcs-storage
      retentionPolicy:
        name: demo-retention
        namespace: demo
    - name: s3-backend
      storageRef:
        namespace: demo
        name: s3-storage
      retentionPolicy:
        name: demo-retention
        namespace: demo
  sessions:
    - name: frequent-backup
      scheduler:
        ---
      repositories:
        - name: gcs-mysql-repo
          backend: gcs-backend
          directory: /mysql-gcs
          encryptionSecret:
            ---
        - name: s3-mysql-repo
          backend: s3-backend
          directory: /mysql-s3
          encryptionSecret:
            ---
      addon:
        name: mysql-addon
        tasks:
          - name: logical-backup
```
- `spec.backends` section configures multiple backends, one for S3 and another for GCS.
- `spec.sessions[0].repositories` section references multiple backends, ensuring that backup data is stored in both destinations.

#### AWS Pod Identity Support

We've added support for `credential-less` backup and restore through AWS Pod Identity. This eliminates the need to manage AWS credentials manually.

Follow the AWS documentation to set up an EKS cluster with `pod-identity`:
- [Pod Identities Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html)
- [How Pod Identity Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-how-it-works.html)
- [Setting Up the Pod Identity Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-agent-setup.html)

### Improvements & Bug Fixes

#### Migrated S3 SDK from aws-sdk-v1 to aws-sdk-v2

We have upgraded our S3 backend codebase from `aws-sdk-v1` to `aws-sdk-v2`, as AWS is deprecating updates for `aws-sdk-v1`. To cooperate with `aws-sdk-v2`, S3 endpoints now require:

- `https://` prefix for public S3 providers.
- `http://` prefix for self-managed or S3-compatible storage.

Below is an updated example of a BackupStorage configuration using the new S3 endpoint format:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.kubestash.com/v1alpha1
kind: BackupStorage
metadata:
  name: s3-storage
  namespace: demo
spec:
  storage:
    provider: s3
    s3:
      bucket: appscode-testing
      region: us-west-2
      endpoint: https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
      secretName: aws-s3-secret
      prefix: appscode-qa
  usagePolicy:
    allowedNamespaces:
      from: All
  default: false
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
```

Here,
- `spec.storage.s3.endpoint` now explicitly includes the `https://` prefix for AWS S3 endpoints.

#### New Deletion Policy for BackupConfiguration

We've introduced a new deletion policy, `Retain`, for BackupConfiguration. This allows users to delete a `BackupConfiguration` while retaining the associated snapshots and repository.

Below is an example of a `BackupConfiguration` with the deletion policy set to `Retain`:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.kubestash.com/v1alpha1
kind: BackupConfiguration
---
spec:
  sessions:
  - name: frequent-backup
    repositories: 
    - name: pvc-backup
      backend: gcs-storage
      directory: /pvc-backup
      encryptionSecret:
       name: encrypt-secret 
       namespace: demo
      deletionPolicy: Retain
---
```
