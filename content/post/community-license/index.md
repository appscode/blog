AppsCode has offered a Community License that will allow testing our various products in a demo namespace for one year. From Jan 1, 2024, users will not be able to issue any new community licenses. Any existing community licenses will continue to work as-is until those expire. We continue to offer a one-time 30 day license for a Kubernetes cluster for FREE to test all the features of our products.

In addition, we will stop offering pre-built binaries and Docker images for the old kubed project. The old Kubed images were showing lots of CVEs for which we were getting support requests. [Open Source Doesn't Require Providing Builds](https://codeengineered.com/blog/2024/open-source-not-builds/). We are not able to offer free support for businesses at this time. The Config Syncer project is open source under the Apache V2 License and will remain so. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/config-syncer/config-syncer . We are offering a commercial verion of this project where we regularly provide security updates and bug fixes. The pricing information can be found on the [project website](https://config-syncer.com/pricing/).
