AppsCode has offered a Community License that allows freely using our various products in a demo namespace since July 1, 2020. Going forward we intend to focus on our commerical offerings. From Jan 1, 2024, users will not be able to issue any new community licenses. Any existing community licenses will continue to work as-is until those expire. We continue to offer a one-time 30 day license for a Kubernetes cluster for FREE to test all the features of our products. This will allow users to use all AppsCode products freely on short-lived clusters like dev or CI/CD clusters.

In addition, we will stop offering pre-built binaries and Docker images for the old kubed project. The old Kubed images were showing lots of CVEs for which we were getting support requests. [Open Source Doesn't Require Providing Builds](https://codeengineered.com/blog/2024/open-source-not-builds/). We are not able to offer free support for businesses at this time. The Config Syncer project is open source under the Apache V2 License and will remain so. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/config-syncer/config-syncer . We are offering a commercial verion of this project where we regularly provide security updates and bug fixes. The pricing information can be found on the [project website](https://config-syncer.com/pricing/).
