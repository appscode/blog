We are pleased to announce the release of [KubeDB v2023.11.2](https://kubedb.com/docs/v2023.11.2/setup/). This post lists all the major changes done in this release since the last release. Find the detailed changelogs [HERE](https://github.com/kubedb/CHANGELOG/blob/master/releases/v2023.11.2/README.md). Letâ€™s see the changes done in this release.

## Breaking Changes

### UpdateVersion ops request

We originally added `Upgrade` ops request to support database version upgrades. Later we introduced `UpdateVersion` ops request and deprecated the `Upgrade` ops request. The reason was that this ops request can be used to either upgrade or downgrade between minor or patch versions. In this release, we have remove the `Upgrade` fields from the ops request CRD schema.

### kubedb-catalog chart values

In this release we have modified the values file schema for `kubedb-catalog` chart to support private registries properly.

## CLI

In this release, a new command has been added to kubedb cli to support checking for alerts generated by Prometheus rules. 

```bash
Examples:
  kubectl dba get-alerts mongodb -n demo sample-mongodb --prom-svc-name=prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus --prom-svc-namespace=monitoring

  Valid resource types include:
  * elasticsearch
  * mongodb
  * mariadb
  * mysql
  * postgres
  * redis

Options:
    --prom-svc-name='':
  name of the prometheus service

    --prom-svc-namespace='':
  namespace of the prometheus service

    --prom-svc-port=9090:
  port of the prometheus service
```
