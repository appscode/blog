## Summary

On 21st September 2022, Appscode held a webinar on **Configure MongoDB Hidden-Node on Kubernetes using KubeDB**. Key contents of the webinars are:
- Introducing the concept of MongoDB Hidden-Node
- How Arbiter works on Replica-set database & Sharded cluster.
- Automatic failover & high availability
- Live Demonstration
- Q & A Session.



## Description of the Webinar

Earlier in this webinar, We discussed the `Hidden-Node` feature for `MongoDB`. Where we showed how to use kubeDBâ€™s newly introduced feature MongoDB hidden node.
We discussed the core concept behind replicaSet & shared-cluster architectures. We also talked about the primary-Election mechanism for automatic failover.


Later in this webinar, We created a hidden-node enabled replicaset database & a `verticalScale` opsRequest to show how to scale the resources for each pod.
We then applied a `reconfigure` opsRequest to change the db-specific internal configurations on the fly.
We also applied a hidden-node enabled sharded cluster, and `volume expansion` & `horizontal scaling` opsRequest on it, to show the scaling of volumes & pod counts respectively.
