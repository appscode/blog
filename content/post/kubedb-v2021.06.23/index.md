* It also fixes the PostgreSQL bug where backups were failing due to missing `sslmode` in the AppBinding. For more details, please refer to [here](https://github.com/stashed/postgres/pull/801).
* Stash now has an Audit event that collects metadata about Stash resources, enabling us to add usage-based billing for PAYG users. It also enables us to better understand how Stash is being used in different environments so that we can improve the product. This is an open-source feature. You can see how we collect the data and what we collect [HERE](https://github.com/bytebuilders/audit). You can disable the feature easily. For disabling see the following code:
