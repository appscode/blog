## Non user facing Changes

In this release, we have updated KubeDB and Stash codebase to use Kubernetes v1.21.1 client libraries. This sets us up for removing support for deprecated api versions in upcoming Kubernetes 1.22 release. In this release, we have also introduced an built-in auditor that collects analytics data for billing purposes. This will be uses in a future release to prepare usage based billing reports for our PAYG customers. This is an open-source feature. You can see how we collect the data and what we collect [HERE](https://github.com/bytebuilders/audit).
