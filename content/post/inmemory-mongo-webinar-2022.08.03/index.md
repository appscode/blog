## Summary

On 3rd August 2022, Appscode held a webinar on **Deploy, Manage & Autoscaler inMemory MongoDB on Kubernetes using KubeDB**. Key contents of the webinars are:
- Introduction to InMemory MongoDB for replicaset & sharded Cluster
- Manual Failover & High Availability
- Vertical & Horizontal Scaling for InMemory databases
- AutoScaling with integrated VPA for InMemory Storage
- Live Demonstration
- Q & A Session.



## Description of the Webinar

Earlier in this webinar, We discussed about the `InMemory Storage Engine` feature for `MongoDB`. Where we showed how to use kubeDBâ€™s feature inMemory Databases. 
We discussed the core concept behind replicaSet & shared-cluster architectures. We also talked about automatic failover & high Availability, And put some manual testing to show that.


On the live demo part, We created a replicaset database with StorageEngine inMemory & StorageType Ephemeral.
We created a `VerticalScaling` opsRequest to show how to scale the resources for each pod & to show how the election makes impact.
We also applied an inMemory sharded cluster & a `HorizontalScaling` opsRequest to show how to scale up the db horizontally.

Later in this webinar, We introduced our new VPA-integrated autoscaler-operator, & argued why one should use it. Then we have showed the autoscaler-operator in action by inserting a bunch of data using script.
