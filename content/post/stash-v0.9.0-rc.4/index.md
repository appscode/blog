We are very excited to announce Stash `v0.9.0-rc.4` which brings some cool features like batch backup and hooks. We have also added `Percona-XtraDB` addon. This version also comes with some bug fixes and general improvements.

[Stash](https://stash.run) by AppsCode is a data backup and recovery solution for Kubernetes workloads. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks, databases etc. Traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. Stash is a Kubernetes operator that uses [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) or Kubernetes CSI Driver VolumeSnapshotter functionality to address these issues. Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in workloads, stand-alone volumes and databases. User may even extend Stash via [addons](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/addons/overview/) for any custom workload.

## What's New

The following new features has been introduced in this version.

### Batch Backup

Sometimes, a single component may not meet the requirement for your application. For example, in order to deploy a WordPress, you will need a Deployment for the WordPress and another Deployment for database to store itâ€™s contents. Now, you may want to backup both of the deployment and database under a single configuration as they are parts of a single application.

In order to support this use case, we are introducing [BackupBatch](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/concepts/crds/backupbatch/) CRD. This allows users to specify multiple targets under single configuration. For more details, please check these guides:

- [BackupBatch CRD Specification](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/concepts/crds/backupbatch/)
- [How Batch Backup Works](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/batch-backup/overview/)
- [An Example of Batch Backup](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/batch-backup/batch-backup/)

### Hooks

You may need to prepare your application before backup/restore. For, example you may want to pause your application before backup and resume it after backup to ensure the backed up data consistency. You may want to send a notification after a backup is completed. Or, you may want to remove corrupted data before restoring. In order to support those use cases, we are introducing `Hooks` in this version.

Stash hooks allows executing certain action before and after a backup/restore process. You can send HTTP requests to a remote server via `httpGet` or `httpPost` hooks. You can check whether a TCP socket is open using `tcpSocket` hook. You can also execute some commands into your application pod using `exec` hook. For more details, please follow these guides:

- [Types of Hooks and How They Works](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/hooks/overview/)
- [Example of Backup and Restore Hooks](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/hooks/backup-and-restore-hooks/)
- [Example of Hooks in Batch Backup](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/hooks/batch-backup-hooks/)
- [How to Configure Different Types of Hooks](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/hooks/configuring-hooks/)

### Percona-XtraDB Addon

We have added a new addon for taking backup `Percona-XtraDB` cluster. Currently, it only supports Percona XtraDB version `5.7`. Please check these guides for more details:

- [What is a Stash Addon](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/addons/overview/)
- [How Percona XtraDB Backup Works](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/addons/percona-xtradb/overview/)
- [How to Install Percona-XtraDB Addon](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/addons/percona-xtradb/setup/install/)
- [Example of How to Backup a Percona-XtraDB Cluster](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/addons/percona-xtradb/guides/5.7/clustered/)
