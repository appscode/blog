We are very excited to announce Stash `v0.9.0-rc.4` which brings some cool features like batch backup and hooks. We have also added `Percona-XtraDB`  addon. This version also comes with some bug fixes and general improvements.

## What's New

The following new features has been introduced in this version.

### Batch Backup

Sometimes, a single component may not meet the requirement for your application. For example, in order to deploy a WordPress, you will need a Deployment for the WordPress and another Deployment for database to store itâ€™s contents. Now, you may want to backup both of the deployment and database under a single configuration as they are parts of a single application.

In order to support this use case, we are introducing [BackupBatch](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/concepts/crds/backupbatch/) CRD. This allows to specify multiple targets under single configuration. For more details, please check these guides:

- [BackupBatch CRD Specification](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/concepts/crds/backupbatch/)
- [How Batch Backup Works](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/batch-backup/overview/)
- [An Example of Batch Backup](https://stash.run/docs/v0.9.0-rc.4/guides/latest/batch-backup/batch-backup/)

### Hooks

You may need to prepare your application before backup/restore. For, example you may want to pause your application before backup and resume it after backup to ensure the backed up data consistency. You may want to send a notification after a backup is completed. Or, you may want to remove corrupted data before restoring. In order to support those use cases, we are introducing `Hooks` in this version.

Stash hooks allows executing certain action before and after a backup/restore process. You can send HTTP requests to a remote server via `httpGet` or `httpPost` hooks. You can check whether a TCP socket is open using `tcpSocket` hook. You can also execute some commands into your application pod using `exec` hook. For more details, please follow these guides:

### Percona-XtraDB Addon

We have added a new addon for taking backup `Percona-XtraDB` cluster. Currently, it only supports Percona XtraDB version `5.7`. Please check these guides for more details:
