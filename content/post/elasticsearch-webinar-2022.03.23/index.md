## Description of the Webinar

Earlier in this webinar, our speaker discussed in detail about `Opensearch`, it's functionalities and use cases. They created an `Opensearch` instance with `Elasticsearch` custom resource and an `Opensearch Dashboard` instance with `ElasticsearchDashboard` custom resource. 

Later in this webinar, he demonstrated basic CRUD operations in `Opensearch` cluster using `Dev Tools` from `Opensearch Dashboards`. After that, the earlier deployed `Opensearch` instance was shown to be upgraded by version with data persistence using `ElasticsearchOpsRequest` . Finally, how to add `Custom Branding` configurations for `opensearch Dashboards` was illustrated step by step.
