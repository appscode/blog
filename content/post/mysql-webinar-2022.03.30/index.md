## Summary

On 30th March 2022 Appscode held a webinar on **"Managing MySQL Semi-synchronous Cluster using KubeDB"**. Key contents of the webinars are:

- Semi-synchronous Replication
- steps to setup Semi-synchronous replication
- Creating and Managing MySQL Semi-synchronous cluster using kubeDB
- Automatic failover of semi-synchronous cluster using kubedb


## Description of the Webinar

The webinar starts with a discussion about various MySQL replication technologies. Then we discuss the details of MySQL semi-synchronous replication. Describe its nature and then move on with what to do if we want to set up a semi-synchronous cluster and the difficulties we will be facing regarding doing things manually.

Later on, MySQL semi-synchronous cluster provisioning is shown that KubeDB makes it easy and reliable. It is also demonstrated how to validate server is running with semi-synchronous replication. In the end, some failover scenarios like replica and primary are explored.
