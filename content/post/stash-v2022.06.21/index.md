We are very excited to announce Stash `v2022.06.21`.  In this release, we have added a few new features and improvements. We have squashed a few bugs as well. You can find the complete changelog [here](https://github.com/stashed/CHANGELOG/blob/master/releases/v2022.06.21/README.md). We are going to highlight the major changes in this post.

## New Features

Here, we are going to highlight the new features that have been introduced in this release.

- **Add timeout for backup and restore**: In this release, we have added timeout for backup and restore. Now, you can mention a timeout in the `spec.task` field of BackupSession or RestoreSession. BackupSession/RestoreSession will be considered as `Failed` if the backup/restore does not complete within this time limit. By default, Stash donâ€™t set any timeout for the backup/restore.

- **Add Hook and timeOut support in Auto-Backup**: We have added Hooks and timeout support in Auto-Backup as well. Now, you can use pre-backup or post-backup Hooks from BackupBlueprint similar to BackupConfiguration.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

We have also fixed few bugs and made some improvements. Here are the notable changes,

- Fix: Fixed a bug by checking if the restore output is nil or not. This nil restore output put the Restore job to CrashloopBackOfff state in some workload restore process [#1448](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1448).
- Fix: Fix RBAC permissions for Backup sidecar and Restore init-container [#1452](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1452).
- Improvement: Update metrics labels for Stash Graphana dashboards [#170](https://github.com/stashed/apimachinery/pull/170).
- Improvement: Clean up dependencies in Stash [#1451](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1451).
- Improvement: Update toolchain to Kubernetes 1.24 [#1450](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1450).
- Improvement: Use Restic 0.13.1 in Stash Addons
