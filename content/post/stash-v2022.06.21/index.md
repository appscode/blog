We are very excited to announce Stash `v2022.06.21`. This release adds support for Kubernetes `v1.24.x`. We have also introduces a few new features and improvements. We have squashed a few bugs as well. You can find the complete changelog [here](https://github.com/stashed/CHANGELOG/blob/master/releases/v2022.06.21/README.md).

We are going to highlight the major changes in this post.

## New Features

Here are the highlighting features of this release:

- **Support Kubernetes `v1.24.x`:** We have upgraded the underlying libraries to support Kubernetes `v1.24.x`. Now, Stash should work flawlessly with the latest Kubernetes version.
- **Add timeout for backup and restore**: You can now specify a timeout for your backup / restore process using `spec.timeOut` field of BackupConfiguration or RestoreSession. Respective backup/restore process will be considered as `Failed` if it does not complete within this time limit. This will ensure that backup process won't get stuck by some kind of network issue. By default, Stash donâ€™t set any timeout for the backup/restore.

- **Add Hook and timeOut support in Auto-Backup**: We have added Hooks and timeout support in Auto-Backup as well. Now, you can specify a backup hook in your BackupBlueprint object.

We have also fixed few bugs and made some improvements. Here are the notable changes,

- Fixed a bug that put the restore job to CrashloopBackOfff state in some workload restore process [#1448](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1448).
- Fix RBAC permissions for backup sidecar and restore init-container [#1452](https://github.com/stashed/stash/pull/1452).
