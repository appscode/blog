- **RotateAuth**: A new `OpsRequest` feature, `RotateAuth`, has been introduced in this release. It allows users to rotate database credentials, enhancing overall security. This feature is now available for `Druid`, `Elasticsearch`, `Kafka`, `MariaDB` `MongoDB`, `PerconaXtraDB`, `Postgres`, and `Solr`.

- **Authentication**: Authentication support has been added for `Memcached`, providing an additional layer of security by verifying client identities before granting access.

- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring capabilities have been introduced for KubeDB-managed `Cassandra` deployments, including integration with Grafana dashboards.

- **Recommendation Engine**: This release includes significant fixes and improvements to the Recommendation Engine.

- **Performance Improvement**: Enhancements to controller performance in this release ensure faster and more efficient operations.

- **New Version Support**: Added support for `Druid` version `30.0.1` and `MongoDB` version `8.0.3`.

For detailed changelogs, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubedb/CHANGELOG/blob/master/releases/v2024.11.18/README.md). You can now explore the detailed features and updates included in this release.

## Rotate Authentication Credentials

In this release, we have introduced a new ops request type `RotateAuth`. This request type is used to rotate the authentication secret for kubedb managed databases. `.spec.authSecret.name` refers to the secret that contains the authentication information for database. The secret should be of type `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`.
Now, If a user wants to update the authentication credentials for a particular database, they can create an OpsRequest of type `RotateAuth` with or without referencing an authentication secret.

If the secret is not referenced, the ops-manager operator will create a new credential and update the current secret. Here is the yaml for rotating authentication credentials for a kafka cluster using `KafkaOpsRequest`,

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kfops-rotate-auth
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: RotateAuth
  databaseRef:
    name: kafka-prod
```

If the secret is referenced, the operator will update the `.spec.authSecret.name` with the new secret name. Here is the yaml:

New Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: enBzY3VscXl2Z3ZhcXZ4ZQ==
  username: c3VwZXI=
kind: Secret
metadata:
   name: kafka-prod-new-auth
   namespace: demo
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kfops-rotate-auth
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: RotateAuth
  databaseRef:
    name: kafka-prod
  authentication:
    secretRef:
      name: kafka-prod-new-auth
 ```

Finally, the operator will update the database cluster with the new credential and the old credentials will be stored in the secret with keys `username.prev` and `password.prev`.

We have added a field `.spec.authSecret.activeFrom` to the db yaml which refers to the timestamp of the credential is active from. We also add an annotations `kubedb.com/auth-active-from` in currently using auth secret which refer to the active from time of this secret.

## Recommendation Engine Improvements

This release includes important fixes and improvements for the Recommendation Engine. The recommendation algorithm for rotating TLS certificates has been updated. Now, a new rotate TLS recommendation for a particular database will be created, if:

1. At least one of its certificate's lifespan is more than one month and less than one month remaining till expiry
2. At least one of its certificates has one-third of its lifespan remaining till expiry.

Here are some of the notable changes in recommendation engine which will be available from this release forward -

- If a recommendation has `status.phase` field set as `InProgess`, it means the recommended Ops-Request is processing. The recommendation will not be marked outdated in this state even if the certificate RenewBefore duration is over.

- Rotate TLS recommendation now comes with a deadline. The deadline refers to the earliest renewal time among all the certificates which are going to be expiring soon.

- The recommendation description has been updated to express more specific information about the certificate that requires renewal.

- The recommendation resync period has been adjusted for more frequent generation.

Following is a generated recommendation object for a mongodb database with TLS security enabled. The recommendation had been approved and recommended ops-request got successfully applied later on.

The updates for each database are detailed below:

## Cassandra

### Monitoring

This release introduces an enhanced monitoring feature for KubeDB managed Cassandra deployments by integrating Grafana dashboards. These dashboards provide comprehensive insights into various Cassandra specific metrics, statuses, as well as visual representations of memory and CPU consumption. With this dashboard, users can effortlessly assess the overall health and performance of Cassandra, enabling more informed decision-making and efficient resource management. You can use builtin [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) scraper or [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) to monitor KubeDB-managed Cassandra.

Have a look [here](https://github.com/ops-center/grafana-dashboards/tree/master/cassandra) for a step-by-step guide on using the monitoring feature of Apache Cassandra.

Hereâ€™s a preview of the Summary dashboard for Cassandra:

![Cassandra Summary Dashboard](cassandra-summary.png)

Additionally, we have added configurable alerting support for KubeDB Cassandra. Users can configure Alertmanager to receive notifications when a metric of Cassandra exceeds a given threshold.

To learn more, have a look here ( https://github.com/appscode/alerts/tree/master/charts )

## Druid

### TLS/SSL Support

In this release, we are introducing **TLS support for Apache Druid**. 

To configure TLS/SSL in Druid, KubeDB utilizes cert-manager to issue certificates. Before proceeding with TLS configuration in Druid, ensure that cert-manager is installed in your cluster. You can follow the steps provided [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) to install cert-manager in your cluster.

To issue a certificate, cert-manager employs the [Issuer/ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) and [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/) Custom Resource (CR).

Here is the TLS enabled Druid YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: Druid
metadata:
  name: druid-cluster-tls
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: 30.0.1
  enableSSL: true
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
      kind: Issuer
      name: druid-ca-issuer
  deepStorage:
    type: s3
    configSecret:
      name: deep-storage-config
  topology:
    routers:
      replicas: 1
  deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### Druid Ops-Requests

We are introducing four new Ops-Requests for `Druid` i.e. `HorizontalScaling`, `Reconfigure`, `UpdateVersion`, `ReconfigreTLS`, `RotateAuth`. You can find the example manifests files to perform these operations on a druid cluster below.

**HorizontalScaling**

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DruidOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: druid-hscale-up
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: HorizontalScaling
  databaseRef:
    name: druid-cluster
  horizontalScaling:
    topology:
      coordinators: 2
      historicals: 2
```

**UpdateVersion**

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DruidOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: druid-update-version
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: UpdateVersion
  databaseRef:
    name: druid-cluster
  updateVersion:
    targetVersion: 30.0.1
  timeout: 5m
  apply: IfReady
```

**Reconfigure**

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DruidOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: reconfigure-drops
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: Reconfigure
  databaseRef:
    name: druid-cluster
  configuration:
    configSecret:
      name: new-config
```
Here, `new-config` is the name of the new custom configuration secret.

**ReconfigureTLS**

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: DruidOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: drops-add-tls
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ReconfigureTLS
  databaseRef:
    name: druid-cluster
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: druid-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        subject:
          organizations:
            - druid
          organizationalUnits:
            - client
  timeout: 5m
  apply: IfReady
```

This is an example showing how to add TLS to an existing druid cluster. ReconfigureTLS also supports features like **Removing TLS**, **Rotating Certificates** or **Changing Issuer**.

**RotateAuth**

`RotateAuth` ops request for Druid has been added. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

### New Version Support

This release adds support for Druid version `30.0.1`, while version `30.0.0` has been marked as deprecated.

## Elasticsearch

In this release, `RotateAuth` OpsRequest has been added for elasticsearch. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

## MariaDB
**RotateAuth OpsRequest**:

We have added support for RotateAuth ops request for MariaDB in this release. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

## Memcached

### Authentication

This release introduces authentication support for Memcached. Previously, connections to the Memcached database did not require authentication. Going forward, a username and password will be required to connect to a Memcached instance.

Users can provide their own username and password using a Kubernetes Secret, or the system will generate default credentials if none are provided.

Below is an example of the YAML configuration:

**Authentication Secret**:

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mc-auth
  namespace: demo
type: Opaque
data:
  authData: YWxpY2U6Ym9iCg==
```

**Memcached YAML**:

```yaml

apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcd-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: "1.6.22"
  authSecret:
    name: mc-auth
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut

```
User can also disable the authentication for Memcached by setting the `disableAuth` field. Here's a simple YAML example:

```yaml

apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcd-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: "1.6.22"
  disableAuth: true
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut

``` 

### TLS/SSL Support

In this release, we introduce TLS support for Memcached.

To configure TLS/SSL in Memcached, KubeDB utilizes cert-manager to issue certificates. Before proceeding with TLS configuration in Memcached, ensure that cert-manager is installed in your cluster. You can follow the steps provided [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) to install cert-manager in your cluster.

To issue a certificate, cert-manager employs the [Issuer/ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) and [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/) Custom Resource (CR).

Here is the TLS enabled Memcached YAML:

```yaml

apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1
kind: Memcached
metadata:
  name: memcd-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: "1.6.22"
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
      kind: Issuer
      name: memcached-ca-issuer
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        ipAddresses:
          - 127.0.0.1
          - 192.168.0.252
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut

```

### Ops-Requests

We are introducing new Ops-Requests for Memcached which is `ReconfigureTLS`. You can find the example manifest file to perform the ops-request operation on Memcached below:

**Reconfigure TLS**

By using Reconfigure TLS Ops-Request, we can add TLS to an existing Memcached which is configured without TLS, can remove TLS configuration from an existing Memcached which is configured with TLS, can rotate the certificates, can change the issuer. The YAML will be like:

```yaml

apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MemcachedOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: mc-add-tls
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ReconfigureTLS
  databaseRef:
    name: memcd-quickstart
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: memcached-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        subject:
          organizations:
            - memcached
          organizationalUnits:
            - client
```

This is an example showing how to add TLS to an existing Memcached database. ReconfigureTLS also supports features like Removing TLS, Rotating Certificates or Changing Issuer.


## Microsoft SQL Server

### Ops-Requests

We are excited to introduce two new Ops-Requests for managing Microsoft SQL Server configurations in Kubernetes: **Reconfigure**, and **Reconfigure TLS**. These allow you to easily modify SQL Server settings and TLS configurations for enhanced flexibility and security. Below, youâ€™ll find examples demonstrating how to use these new features.

**Reconfigure Ops-Request**

The `Reconfigure` operation enables you to update the configuration of an existing SQL Server cluster. This can be achieved using a custom configuration secret or by specifying configurations directly in the manifest.

Example 1: Using a Custom Configuration Secret

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MSSQLServerOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: msops-reconfigure
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: Reconfigure
  databaseRef:
    name: mssqlserver-cluster
  configuration:
    configSecret:
      name: new-custom-config # Reference to the custom configuration secret
  timeout: 5m
  apply: IfReady # Apply only if the database is ready
```

Here, `new-custom-config` refers to the name of the custom configuration secret containing your desired SQL Server settings.

Example 2: Applying Inline Configuration

You can reconfigure using applyConfig like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MSSQLServerOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: msops-reconfigure-apply
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: Reconfigure
  databaseRef:
    name: mssqlserver-cluster
  configuration:
    applyConfig:
      mssql.conf: |-
        [memory]
        memorylimitmb = 3072
  timeout: 5m
  apply: IfReady
```

In this example, the `applyConfig` field is used to specify the new configuration for the `mssql.conf` file directly in the Ops-Request manifest.

**ReconfigureTLS OpsRequest**

The ReconfigureTLS operation allows you to add, remove, or modify TLS configurations for an existing SQL Server cluster. It also supports advanced use cases like **rotating certificates** or **changing the certificate issuer**.

Example 1: Adding TLS to a Cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MSSQLServerOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: msops-add-tls
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ReconfigureTLS
  databaseRef:
    name: mssql-cluster
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer # Name of the cert-manager issuer
      kind: Issuer # Issuer type (Issuer or ClusterIssuer)
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        subject:
          organizations:
            - mssqlserver
          organizationalUnits:
            - client
    clientTLS: true # Enable client TLS
  timeout: 5m
  apply: IfReady
```

This example demonstrates how to add TLS to an existing SQL Server cluster using certificates issued by `mssqlserver-ca-issuer`.

Other Supported TLS Actions:

**Remove TLS**: Disable TLS for the SQL Server cluster.

tls Spec:
```yaml
tls:
  remove: true # Remove existing TLS configuration
```

**Rotate Certificates**: Rotate the TLS certificates used by the SQL Server cluster.

tls Spec:
```yaml
tls:
  rotateCertificates: true # Trigger certificate rotation
```

**Change the Certificate Issuer**: Update the issuer of the TLS certificate to a new one.

tls Spec:
```yaml
tls:
  issuerRef:
    name: mssqlserver-new-ca-issuer # New cert-manager issuer name
    kind: Issuer # Issuer type (Issuer or ClusterIssuer)
    apiGroup: "cert-manager.io" 
```

### MSSQLServer Breaking Changes

> - `spec.internalAuth`: The `spec.internalAuth` section has been removed. TLS/SSL configurations for internal endpoint authentication of SQL Server Availability Group replicas should now be defined under `spec.tls`.
> - **Leader Election Configuration**: The field `spec.leaderElection` is now moved under `spec.topology.availabilityGroup.leaderElection`.

Below is the updated structure reflecting these changes:

```yaml
tls:
  issuerRef:
    apiGroup: cert-manager.io
    kind: Issuer
    name: mssqlserver-ca-issuer
  certificates:
    - alias: endpoint
      secretName: mssqlserver-endpoint-cert
      subject:
        organizationalUnits:
          - endpoint
        organizations:
          - kubedb
  clientTLS: true
topology:
  availabilityGroup:
    databases:
      - agdb1
      - agdb2
    leaderElection:
      electionTick: 10
      heartbeatTick: 1
      period: 300ms
      transferLeadershipInterval: 1s
      transferLeadershipTimeout: 1m0s
  mode: AvailabilityGroup
```

> **Note**: Use `spec.tls` to configure all TLS/SSL-related settings, including endpoint authentication for Availability Group replicas.

### Configuring MSSQL Environment Variables

When deploying `Microsoft SQL Server` on Linux containers, environment variables are used to configure various settings, including the product edition.

You have to specify the SQL Server product edition using the `MSSQL_PID` environment variable. The acceptable values for `MSSQL_PID` are:

- `Developer`: Uses the Developer Edition (default if no MSSQL_PID is specified).
- `Express`: Uses the Express Edition.
- `Standard`: Uses the Standard Edition.
- `Enterprise`: Uses the Enterprise Edition.
- `EnterpriseCore`: Uses the Enterprise Edition Core.
- `<valid product id>`: Uses the edition associated with the specified product ID.

- In addition, the `ACCEPT_EULA` environment variable is required to confirm your acceptance of the [End-User Licensing Agreement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-configure-environment-variables?view=sql-server-ver16#environment-variables:~:text=ACCEPT_EULA,SQL%20Server%20image.). It must be set, to allow the SQL Server container to run.

**Example YAML Configuration**:

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure the `MSSQL_PID` and `ACCEPT_EULA` environment variables in the KubeDB MSSQLServer CRD:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: mssqlserver
  namespace: demo
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mssql
        env:
        - name: ACCEPT_EULA
          value: "Y"
        - name: MSSQL_PID
          value: Enterprise
```

In this example, the SQL Server container will run the **Enterprise Edition** of SQL Server.

To know more about these environment variables and their usage, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-configure-environment-variables?view=sql-server-2017)

## MongoDB

- We bring support for latest MongoDB release `8.0.3`

- We have introduced a new ops request type `RotateAuth` for MongoDB. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

- Fix archiver for TLS-enabled s3-compatible storage.

## MySQL

Multi-Primary support for Group Replication has been added in this release. Currently, MySQL version `8.4.2` supports Multi-Primary mode. You must specify `Multi-Primary` in the `spec.topology.group.mode` section of MySQL Group Replication's YAML configuration. By default, it operates in `Single-Primary` group mode. Below is an example YAML configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: MySQL
metadata:
  name: my-multi-primary
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "8.4.2"
  replicas: 3
  topology:
    mode: GroupReplication
    group:
      mode: Multi-Primary
  storageType: Durable
  storage:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
  terminationPolicy: WipeOut
```

## PerconaXtraDB
**RotateAuth OpsRequest**:

We have added support for RotateAuth ops request for PerconaXtraDB in this release. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

## PgBouncer

In this release, we have configured TLS in PgBouncer. Also, Restart has been added.

### TLS/SSL Support

In this release, we have configured tls in PgBouncer.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1
kind: PgBouncer
metadata:
  name: pb-tls
  namespace: demo
spec:
  sslMode: verify-full
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: cert-manager.io
      name: pb-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
    certificates:
    - alias: server
      subject:
        organizations:
        - kubedb:server
      dnsNames:
      - localhost
      ipAddresses:
      - "127.0.0.1"
  version: "1.18.0"
  replicas: 1
  database:
    syncUsers: true
    databaseName: "postgres"
    databaseRef:
      name: "pg-server"
      namespace: demo
  connectionPool:
    port: 5432
    reservePoolSize: 5
    authType: md5
  deletionPolicy: WipeOut
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pgbouncer
```

### Ops-Requests Support

**Restart**

Restart ops request is used to perform a smart restart of the PgBouncer. An example YAML is provided below:

```yaml
apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: PgBouncerOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pb-restart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: pb
  type: Restart
```

## Postgres

- In this release, we improved the postgres point time recovery to support seamless archiving and recovery with db pods spread out in different zones in a single region. We also improved our algorithm to calculate and find the suitable base backup for PITR.

- We also fixed a bug which wasnâ€™t letting users use postgres `warm` standby mode via `db.spec.standbyMode`. Now if your `db.spec.standbyMode` is set to `Warm`, then your db replicas will behave like warm standby which will only be used to store data, not open for read queries. If you want to send your read queries to your replicas, make sure you put `db.spec.standbyMode: Hot` which is set by default from this release.

- Also fixed archiver for TLS-enabled s3-compatible storage.

- In this release, we also have introduced a new ops request type `RotateAuth` for Postgres. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.

## Solr

Solr autoscaler support has been added in this release. KubeDB autoscaler leverages the automation of  storage and memory autoscaling with the help of metrics-server and prometheus.

**Computer Autoscaler**:

Computer autoscaler deals with scaling cpu and memory, and we need metrics-server in our cluster for this operation.

For combined cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: SolrAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sl-node-autoscaler
  namespace: demo
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: solr-combined
  opsRequestOptions:
    timeout: 5m
    apply: IfReady
  compute:
    node:
      trigger: "On"
      podLifeTimeThreshold: 5m
      resourceDiffPercentage: 5
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2Gi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 3Gi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
      containerControlledValues: "RequestsAndLimits"
```

For dedicated cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: SolrAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sl-data-autoscaler
  namespace: demo
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: solr-cluster
  opsRequestOptions:
    timeout: 5m
    apply: IfReady
  compute:
    data:
      trigger: "On"
      podLifeTimeThreshold: 5m
      resourceDiffPercentage: 5
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2.5Gi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 3Gi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
      containerControlledValues: "RequestsAndLimits"
    overseer:
      trigger: "On"
      podLifeTimeThreshold: 5m
      resourceDiffPercentage: 5
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2.5Gi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 3Gi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
      containerControlledValues: "RequestsAndLimits"
    coordinator:
      trigger: "On"
      podLifeTimeThreshold: 5m
      resourceDiffPercentage: 5
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2.5Gi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 3Gi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
      containerControlledValues: "RequestsAndLimits"
```

**Storage Autoscaler**:
Storage autoscaler deal with scaling pvc storage with the help of prometheus. So, we need prometheus in the cluster for this operation

For combined cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: SolrAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sl-storage-autoscaler-combined
  namespace: demo
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: solr-combined
  storage:
    node:
      expansionMode: "Offline"
      trigger: "On"
      usageThreshold: 10
      scalingThreshold: 100
```

For dedicated cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: SolrAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sl-storage-autoscaler-topology
  namespace: demo
spec:
  databaseRef:
    name: solr-cluster
  storage:
    data:
      expansionMode: "Offline"
      trigger: "On"
      usageThreshold: 60
      scalingThreshold: 100
    overseer:
      expansionMode: "Offline"
      trigger: "On"
      usageThreshold: 60
      scalingThreshold: 100
```

**RotateAuth OpsRequest**:

We have also added support for RotateAuth ops request for `Solr` in this release. Check out [Rotate Authentication Credentials](#rotate-authentication-credentials) section for a deep dive.


## ZooKeeper

### TLS/SSL Support

In this release, we introduce **TLS support for ZooKeeper**.

To configure TLS/SSL in ZooKeeper, KubeDB utilizes cert-manager to issue certificates. Before proceeding with TLS configuration in ZooKeeper, ensure that cert-manager is installed in your cluster. You can follow the steps provided [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) to install cert-manager in your cluster.

To issue a certificate, cert-manager employs the [Issuer/ClusterIssuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/) and [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/) Custom Resource (CR).

To configure tls in zookeeper:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubedb.com/v1alpha2
kind: ZooKeeper
metadata:
  name: zk-quickstart
  namespace: demo
spec:
  version: "3.8.3"
  enableSSL: true
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
      kind: Issuer
      name: zookeeper-ca-issuer
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        ipAddresses:
        - 127.0.0.1
        - 192.168.0.252
  adminServerPort: 8080
  replicas: 5
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: "1Gi"
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
  deletionPolicy: "WipeOut"
```

### Ops-Requests Support

**Reconfigure TLS**

By using Reconfigure TLS Ops-Request, we can add TLS to an existing ZooKeeper which is configured without TLS, can remove TLS configuration on existing ZooKeeper which is configured with TLS, can rotate the certificates, can change the issuer. The Yaml will be like:

```yaml

apiVersion: ops.kubedb.com/v1alpha1
kind: ZooKeeperOpsRequest
metadata:
  name: myops-add-tls-2
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ReconfigureTLS
  databaseRef:
    name: zk-quickstart
  tls:
    issuerRef:
      name: zookeeper-ca-issuer
      kind: Issuer
      apiGroup: "cert-manager.io"
    certificates:
      - alias: client
        subject:
          organizations:
            - zookeeper
          organizationalUnits:
            - client
```

This is an example showing how to add TLS to an existing ZooKeeper database. ReconfigureTLS also supports features like Removing TLS, Rotating Certificates or Changing Issuer.
