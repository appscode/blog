Kubernetes upholds the philosophy that the core should be small and allow developers to write their own extensions. One way to introduce new resource types is using CustomResourceDefintions (CRD) (originally known as ThirdPartyResources). Using CRDs anyone can define a new resource type that behaves like standard Kubernetes resources. This allows anyone to write a controller for custom resources and capture operational knowledge in a software form.</description></item><item><title>Secure Kubernetes using eBPF &amp; Open Policy Agent</title><link>https://blog.byte.builders/post/bpf-opa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.byte.builders/post/bpf-opa/</guid><description>Securing Kubernetes cluster is a multi-faceted task. Runtime security is one aspect of it. It ensures that the workloads deployed in the cluster doesn&amp;rsquo;t do any malicious behaviors. For runtime instrumentation, we wanted to use Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), a core technology in the Linux kernel.
There are already many tools available in this space, but each project has its own custom components. We want to use a set of common set of tools and techniques for binding these different components.</description></item><item><title>Kubeform - Provision cloud resources using CRDs &amp; Terraform</title><link>https://blog.byte.builders/post/introducing-kubeform/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.byte.builders/post/introducing-kubeform/</guid><description>Kubeform by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Terraform. Kubeform provides auto-generated Kubernetes CRDs for Terraform resources and modules so that you can manage any cloud infrastructure in a Kubernetes native way. You just write a CRD for a cloud infrastructure, apply it and Kubeform will create it for you! Kubeform currently supports 5 top cloud platforms. These are AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digitalocean and Linode.
The key features of Kubeform are:</description></item><item><title>Introducing ResourceDescriptor: A Generic API for defining Kuberbnetes Resource Graph</title><link>https://blog.byte.builders/post/resourcedescriptor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.byte.builders/post/resourcedescriptor/</guid><description>Kubernetes has own the container orchestrator war. One of the key contributors to its success is the ability to extend Kubernetes by the end users. The primary way users extend Kubernetes is by defining new resource types. This is called Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) in the Kubernetes parlance. Users can write a controller that can reconcile users&amp;rsquo; desired specification to a cluster. Controllers that capture operational knowledge of a software application are commonly know as Kubernetes operators.</description></item></channel></rss>
